\section{Sections and subsections}
\label{sec:sec_and_subsec}
It is convenient to organize the Executive Summary of your thesis into sections and subsections. 
If necessary, subsubsections, paragraphs and subparagraphs can be also used. 
A new section or subsection can be included  with the commands
\begin{verbatim}
\section{Title of the section}
\end{verbatim}
\begin{verbatim}
\subsection{Title of the subsection}
\end{verbatim}
It is recommended to give a label to each section by using the command
\begin{verbatim}
\label{sec:section_name}%
\end{verbatim}
where the argument is just a text string that you'll use to reference that part
as follows: \textit{Section~\ref{sec:sec_and_subsec} contains \sc{SECTIONS AND SUBSECTIONS}  \dots}.
