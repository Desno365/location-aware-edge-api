In this thesis, we have addressed several key issues related to stateful serverless computing on the edge by designing and implementing a new solution. However, with our solution, not every use case can be fulfilled, in fact the absence of \textbf{session consistency} makes the usage impractical in a dynamic context where the location of the client changes.
Therefore a possible improvement and a possible research direction could be session consistency in the context of stateful serverless computing on the edge.

Another problem with our solution is the possibility for edge locations to be overwhelmed due to random spikes in requests targeting a specific location: our solution does not support the \textbf{offload of the computation} to free up some resources from an overloaded node. On the contrary, for how we thought our solution, in some use cases it's important to be static and to always reach the same node. 

In the context of serverless computing a common problem is the phenomenon of \textbf{cold-start}, which impacts processing latency. There exist solutions that firmly mitigated the problem reaching milliseconds cold-start latencies (like the solution provided by Cloudflare Workers), but unfortunately these solutions are currently proprietary.
