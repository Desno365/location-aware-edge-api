\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

This document is intended to be both an example of the Polimi \LaTeX{} template for the Executive Summary
of your thesis, as well as a short introduction to its use.

The Executive Summary is required only
if the thesis has been assigned to a reviewer (\textit{controrelatore})
for an independent evaluation of its quality, scientific/technical relevance and original contribution.
