\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Context}
This is basically an extension of the abstract. Here you provide context for the problem faced. Keep in mind that even if you now have gained expertise on it, most of the readers are no so inside the problem as you are. Start from the basics and explain clearly. You can also introduce here some hints about the methodology and your contribution. For this purpose, you may also decide to add more sections.

\section{Thesis outline}

\begin{example}
The thesis is structured in the following way:
\begin{itemize}
\item In \autoref{ch:preliminaries_and_sota}, we present ... .
\item In \autoref{ch:problem_formulation}, we formulate the problem we address in the thesis and ... .
\item In \autoref{ch:design}, we present our solution for ... .
\item In \autoref{ch:experiments}, we show experimental results of our proposed methods in different settings ... .
\item Finally, in \autoref{ch:conclusions}, we present our conclusions and possible future paths toward which our work could be extended.
\end{itemize}
